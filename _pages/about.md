I am currently working as a [research associate](https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/vwl/wuw/die-professur/mitarbeiter/simon-johannes-bolz) and pursuing my Ph.D. in Economics at the Chair of Economic Policy and Economic Research at Dresden University of Technology, Germany. My research centers on the intersection of international trade and environmental economics, with a particular emphasis on firm heterogeneity. Extending trade models by emission generation, I analyze the impacts of policy measures, such as unilateral carbon pricing, border carbon adjustments and trade liberalization on aggregate carbon emissions and overall welfare. Additionally, I am working with Indian firm-level data to investigate how companies' engagement in importing and exporting influences their environmental impact. I am also teaching exercise classes in Public and International Economic Theory (Winter) as well as Economics of Inequality (Summer).
