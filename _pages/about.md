My research centers on the intersection of international trade and environmental economics, with a particular emphasis on firm heterogeneity. By extending Melitz-style trade models to incorporate emission generation, I analyze the impacts of policy measures such as unilateral carbon pricing, border carbon adjustments, and trade liberalization on aggregate CO2 emissions and overall welfare. Additionally, I am working with Indian firm-level data to investigate how companies' engagement in importing and exporting influences their environmental impact.
